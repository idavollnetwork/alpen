# Design Scheme 

The following flow chart demonstrate three crucial steps of our new investment DAO.



#### Space Creation:

Any experienced investor can create an investment space on platform by submitting required info and waiting for community's decision.

#### Investment Proposal:

The space owner can create an investment proposal by stating the investing target, the needed amount and the funding period. An investment vault is generated for the owner upon proposal creation and other members can donate/invest their fund into the vault. The owner can access fund in the vault after the period is closed and can use fund to purchase NFT on different marketplaces or swap tokens on different DEXs

#### Asset Sale Proposal:

Any member can create an asset sale proposal. The proposal contains the expected sale assets, the target price and a reason for the sale. After the proposal is published, all members in the space can vote on the proposal and the owner of the space will be granted access to the asset if vote result passes threshold and finalize the sale on a suitable platform.
